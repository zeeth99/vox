Welcome to VOXSPELL!

#BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING
Please make sure that :

1. There is a directory containing the following files:
	VOXSPELL.jar
	runVoxspell.sh
	big_buck_bunny_1_minute.avi

2. Festival is downloaded and installed as well as have the following voices installed:
	(voice_kal_diphone)
	(voice_akl_nz_jdt_diphone)
If either voice is not installed the program will run, but instructions will be silent with that voice selected

3. Java Version 1.8 is installed at the following directory:
	/usr/lib/jvm/jdk8/

Run the runVoxspell.sh file. To do this, at the command line (with the working directory conatining VOXSPELL.jar and runVoxspell.sh), execute the following line:
	./runVoxspell.sh

Notes For Peer Reviewers
========================

GUI file selection will happen, don't worry. In fact, it may have already happened if I forget to remove this after implmenting it.
I'm gonna have a better sound reward cos Mr. Festival aint very congratulatory.
Category Deletion will happen, cos otherwise that list will get hella crowded.
I'll make it more visually apparent whether a word is correct or not.
Wow, this really collects my ideas. I just need to look here whenever I'm looking for what to do next, thanks peer reviewer.
