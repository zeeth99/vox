	VOXSPELL
=========================

Welcome to VOXSPELL!

BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING
Please make sure that :

1. Within the same directory as the files 'VOXSPELL.jar' and 'runVoxspell.sh', make sure there is a file named 'NZCER-spelling-lists.txt' (without quotation marks) within that same directory. If one does not exist there, please create one or get one from somewhere as you cannot attempt a quiz without this file present

2. Within the same home directory as the files 'VOXSPELL.jar' and 'runVoxspell.sh', make sure there is a file named 'big_buck_bunny_1_minute.avi' (you guessed it, without the quotation marks) within the same directory. If one does not exist, please make sure one exists to enable any video reward at the end of a quiz

3. Festival is downloaded and installed as well as have the following voices installed:
	(voice_kal_diphone)
	(voice_akl_nz_jdt_diphone)
4. Java Version 1.8 is installed at the following directory:
	/usr/lib/jvm/jdk8/

A script file is included which you will need to execute in order to run the application if you have Java 1.8 installed
but is not the default version of Java.

IF JAVA 1.8 IS NOT YOUR DEFAULT VERSION OF JAVA BUT YOU HAVE IT INSTALLED AT THE DIRECTORY MENTIONED ABOVE IN POINT 4, run the runVoxspell.sh file. To do this, at the command line (with the current directory being the one where runVoxspell.sh is in), execute the following:
	
	./runVoxspell.sh

NOTE: Make sure that the runVoxspell.sh and VOXSPELL.jar files are in the same directory when you execute the script file with
the command above and also that points 1 and 2 have been fulfilled


IF JAVA 1.8 IS YOUR DEFAULT VERSION OF JAVA, you may just run the VOXSPELL.jar jar file to run VOXSPELL without running the script file. 
IF YOU RUN IT THIS WAY note that the files 'NZCER-spelling-lists.txt' and 'big_buck_bunny_1_minute.avi' need to exist in the home directory and not the directory that the jar file is located in. (unless the jar file is in the home directory)

Enjoy!
