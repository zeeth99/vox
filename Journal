So far a large portion of my time has gone into refactoring the code from assignment 2. This refactoring has made it easier for us to work on the project at the same time. This is because merging work from two people on the same file is more difficult than if they are working on different files.
Ray is working on making festival proccess in the background. He has completed this and now is looking into rearranging the calls to festival so that festival does not talk over itself. 
The mode select screen is now up and running. This screen allows the user to choose a level to quiz at or select the review quiz type.
Our next tasks are tweaking festival calls, adding level differentiation to the statistics, and giving the option to proceed to the next level after doing well in a quiz.

Working on implementing and fixing a SwingWorker class which handles text to speech so that the GUI is responsive while it reads out
the word to spell.

Added level progression to the quiz which allows user to go from one level to the next when they get 9 out of 10 words correct. Still need to add video reward at the end of completing a level as well as decided on whether to 'complete' the quiz before giving the options
of progressing, retrying or the video.
Implemented leveling in Review Mode. A level select for review may be good but for the assignment it was fine to begin at level 1. Lots
of new files added to store words to be reviewed (one for each level).
